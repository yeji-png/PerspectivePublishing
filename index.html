        Post-Artifact Books and Publishing: Digital's effect on how we produce,
        distribute and consume content. Craig Mod, June 2011 What is a book,
        anymore, anyway? We will always debate: the quality of the paper, the
        pixel density of the display; the cloth used on covers, the interface
        for highlighting; location by page, location by paragraph. Stop there.
        Hunting surface analogs between the printed and the digital book is a
        dangerous honeypot. There is a compulsion to believe the magic of a book
        lies in its surface. In reality, the book worth considering consists
        only of relationships. Relationships between ideas and recipients.
        Between writer and reader. Between readers and other readers — all as
        writ over time. The future book — the digital book — is no longer an
        immutable brick. It's ethereal and networked, emerging publicly in fits
        and starts. An artifact 'complete' for only the briefest of moments.
        Shifting deliberately. Layered with our shared marginalia. And demanding
        engagement with the promise of community implicit in its form. The book
        of the past reveals its individual experience uniquely. The book of the
        future reveals our collective experience uniquely. For those of us
        looking to shape the future of books and publishing, where do we begin?
        Simply, these are our truths: The way books are written has changed. The
        canvas for books has changed. The post-published life of a book has
        changed. To think about the future of the book is to understand the
        links between these changes. To think about the future of the book is to
        think about the future of all content. So intertwined are our words and
        images and platforms, that to consider individual parts of the
        publishing process in isolation is to miss transformative connections.
        These connections shaping books and publishing live in emergent systems
        behind the words. Between the writing and the publishing, publishing and
        consuming, consuming and sharing. We have an opportunity now to shape
        these systems. And in doing so, to refine the relationships between
        authors, publishers, readers and texts. What tools will we embed within
        digital artifacts to signal this shifting relationship with literature?
        To surface our shared experience? To bridge the raw pre- and post-
        artifact spaces that so define the future of publishing? To build the
        future book? 1. The book, a system Books are systems. They emerge from
        systems. They themselves are systems — the best of which are as complex
        as is necessary, and not one bit more. And once complete, new systems
        develop around their content. To understand where books and publishing
        are moving, it is critical to understand the following three systems:
        the pre-artifact system the system of the artifact the post-artifact
        system The pre-artifact system is where the book or story or article is
        made. It's a system full of (and fueled by) whiskey, self-doubt,
        confusion, debauchery and a general sense of hopelessness.
        Traditionally, it's been a system of isolation, involving very few
        people. The key individuals within the classic manifestation of this
        system are the author and the editor. A publisher, perhaps. A muse. But
        generally, not the reader. The end product of this system is what we
        usually define as 'the book' — the Idea made tangible. The artifact —
        the book — too, is a system. Traditionally, an island unto itself.
        Immutable. A system self-contained. One requiring great efforts to
        extend beyond the binding. When finished, it becomes a souvenir of a
        private journey. Finally, the post-artifact system. This is the space in
        which we engage the artifact. Again, traditionally a relatively static
        space. Isolated. Friends can gather to discuss the artifact. Localized
        classes can be constructed in universities around the artifact. But,
        generally, there is an overwhelming sense of disconnection from the
        other systems. Digital changes this. Most fundamentally digital removes
        isolation. Removes it from the pre-, artifact, and post- systems. The
        corollaries: an increase in connectivity. Mutability of artifact.
        Continuous engagement with readers. And most excitingly, a potentially
        public record of change, comment, discussion — digital marginalia —
        layered atop the artifact, adding to the artifact, and redefining
        'complete.' With the connection of these systems, our classic definition
        of a literary artifact no longer applies. And our common understanding
        of publishing systems is irrevocably disrupted. 2. Pre-artifact systems
        With the emergence and growing adoption of the Kindle and the iPad,
        publishers, writers, readers and software-makers have concerned
        themselves with shoehorning the old-media image of a book into new
        media. Everyone asks, 'How do we change books to read them digitally?'
        But the more interesting question is, 'How does digital change books?'
        And, similarly, 'How does digital change the authorship process?' This
        authorial shift is critical to the understanding of the new pre-artifact
        system. With digital impermanence (a new kind of ephemerality) comes two
        concepts key to the future of storytelling and books: We can
        continuously develop a text in realtime, erasing the preciousness imbued
        by printing. And because of this ... Time itself becomes an active
        ingredient in authorship (in contrast to authorship happening in a
        seemingly timeless place, a finished product suddenly emerging).
        Wikipedia is a fully realized example of how digital drastically affects
        authorship. By creating a system that allows collective edits in
        real-time, Wikipedia has embedded iterative writing into its foundation.
        Nothing on that site is precious. No letter, word, sentence or article
        is immune to reconsideration. And yet, by tracking changes on a micro
        scale, they've built trust around a continuously evolving system.
        Consider the physical analog to Wikipedia — the encyclopedia set. In the
        early naughts, it would have been difficult to imagine that a website
        written and edited by hundreds of thousands of people, constantly
        mutating, could have possibly formed the replacement for that dusty set
        of leather bound books on your bookshelf. And yet, not only has
        Wikipedia replaced the physical encyclopedia for many of us, but it's
        surpassed it in usefulness, quality, timeliness and perhaps most
        significantly, convenience. The core editorial ethos of the physical
        encyclopedia still informs Wikipedia, but the ways in which content is
        created, shared, and edited are born from digital. Take a set of
        encyclopedias and ask, "How do I make this digital?" You get a Microsoft
        Encarta CD. Take the philosophy of encyclopedia-making and ask, "How
        does digital change our engagement with this?" You get Wikipedia. When
        we think about digital's effect on storytelling, we tend to grasp for
        the lowest hanging imaginative fruits. The common cliche is that digital
        will 'bring stories to life.' Words will move. Pictures become movies.
        Narratives will be choose-your-own-adventure. While digital does make
        all of this possible, these are the changes of least radical importance
        brought about by digitization of text. These are the answers to the
        question, "How do we change books to make them digital?" The essence of
        digital's effect on publishing requires a subtle shift towards the
        query: "How does digital change books?" 2a. A few examples (Companies
        and individuals leveraging changes in publishing systems): As much as it
        may pain literary purists to admit, blogs have been laying the
        foundation for this kind of on-the-fly contemporary book writing for
        over a decade. 37Signals' title, Getting Real, was composed over the
        course of years on their blog Signal vs. Noise. RSS subscribers to
        Signal vs. Noise had been reading Getting Real without knowing it. Heck,
        37Signals had been writing Getting Real without knowing it. Consider
        that they sold 30,000 PDFs at $19 a piece. That's over half a million
        dollars in revenue (profit, really — there are no distribution costs or
        middle men). For a book that was authored publicly. And this, in 2006.
        Frank Chimero has been sketching a book live. It's his blog. He's been
        working hard at fleshing out ideas around creativity and design for
        years now. And he's built up such a community of supporters, they paid
        him $100,000 in February 2011 to go deeper. The Shape of Design promises
        to continue exploring the narrative threads on his site. To formalize.
        In Spring of 2010, Ashley Rawlings and I ran a campaign to crowd-fund
        the production and publication of the second edition of Art Space Tokyo.
        We raised $24,000 in a month. And shared the entire process in
        painstaking detail for others to replicate. Robin Sloan has been writing
        and releasing short stories in digital formats for the grateful many of
        us fans. He is now returning to dive deeper into those pieces that had
        particular resonance with his intended audience — fleshing out shorter
        works into full length novels. Amanda Hocking writes a blog. She also
        publishes her novels independently on the Amazon Kindle platform.
        They've done well. In the past year she's sold over a million Kindle
        books. John from I Love Typography has been writing a publication live.
        It's — surprise! — his blog. And now he, too, (with the help of editor
        Carolyn Wood and friends) is formalizing his ideas into the bona-fide
        journal, Codex. Beautifully produced, masterfully edited, Codex is a
        collection of thoughtfully curated pieces on typography. A compendium of
        John's love for type wrapped, marketed and priced in a way that takes
        advantage of his amazing community. It leverages changes to the classic
        publishing system to make it self-sustainable. Seth Godin has been so
        deeply influenced by his blog's readership and the strength of his
        community that he threw his hands up and flat-out started his own
        publishing company. Domino comes from ideas that emerged in front of the
        audience he was ultimately trying to reach. It's a beautiful example of
        a sustainable ecosystem emerging from wholesome conversation. The list
        continues indefinitely. To be even more hyperbolic: we are amidst
        undeniable, fundamental change to authoring processes. The friction and
        distance between you and your readership? Gone. The 'live iteration'
        born from these changes frees authors from isolation (but still allows
        them to write in isolation). The audience and author become conversant
        sooner. Writers can gauge reader interest as the story unfolds and
        decide which topics are worth further exploration. As 37Signals, Frank,
        John, Robin, Amanda and Seth refined their authorial philosophy before
        an audience of tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of readers, it's easy
        to imagine the subtle editorial push and pull by the number of page
        views and comments they received on each blog entry. Which is to say,
        these frictionless, often indirect reader actions brought by digital to
        the pre-artifact system can manifest in the final authorial output.
        Richard Nash of Soft Skull publishing fame and more recently founder of
        literary startup Cursor, has placed this pre-artifact system squarely in
        his sights. On why the disruption of the pre-artifact system is so
        necessary — hell, even morally required — he says: We have tended to
        speak of the model of publishing for the last hundred years as if it
        were a perfect one, but look at all the indie presses that arose in the
        last 20 years, publishing National Book Award winners, Pulitzer winners,
        Nobel winners. What happened to those books before? They weren't
        published! They. Were. Not. Published. Sure, some were, but most? Nope.
        We cannot know how much magnificent culture went unpublished by the
        white men in tweed jackets who ran publishing for the past century but
        just because they did publish some great books doesn't mean they didn't
        ignore a great many more ... So we're restoring the, we think, the
        natural balance of things the ecosystem of writing and reading. His new
        imprint, Red Lemonade, is built to elicit conversations around books.
        Often before they're complete. Certainly a terrifying notion for many,
        but also an inevitable product of the opening of the pre-artifact
        system. And like many things inevitable in the evolution of entrenched
        methodologies — you can either bemoan and lament and eulogize the old,
        or become an active participant in the shaping of the future. Of course,
        no author is obligated to embrace or engage these changes. But these
        changes do beg the question: just where does the digital artifact begin
        and end? When is it 'completed?' 3. The fall of the great, immutable
        artifact The digital book is a strange beast. It's intangible and yet
        wholly mutable. Everywhere and nowhere. We own it, but yet, don't. Its
        qualities mimic physical books only on a meta-level. To truly understand
        how strange and special they are, it helps to have experience with their
        analog cousins. Have you ever made a physical book before? What I mean
        is, have you ever edited and sent the files to a printer to be
        reproduced several thousand times? It's terrifying. There is a pervasive
        hopelessness to the entire process. You know there must be mistakes.
        Check page numbers and punctuation a hundred times still, and by the
        sheer magnitude of molecules composing a book, you will miss something.
        So submitting that file to be printed is to place ultimate faith in the
        book. To believe — because you must for the sake of sanity! — that this
        is the best you can do given the constraints. And you will have to live
        with the results forever. This is what makes physical so weighty. So
        precious. No matter how much you prepare, if you haven't executed well,
        any misstep will be writ a thousand times over. When someone says 'book'
        this is what we think of (but, curiously, we may be one of the last
        generations to think this). A very specific physicality. We imagine the
        thick cover. The well defined interior block. We feel the permanence of
        the object. Inside, the words are embedded in the paper. What's printed
        there today will be the same stuff tomorrow. It's reliable. With
        digital, these qualities of printed books listed above become
        artificial. There is no thick cover constraining length. There are no
        additional printing costs for color. There is no permanence: the once
        sacred, unchanging nature of the text is sacred no longer. Updating
        digital text is trivially easy. When you look at the same digital book
        tomorrow, it may very well be different from the version you read today.
        Outside of these obvious superficial differences, there are two
        qualities to digital artifacts that make them drastically different from
        physical artifacts: they have a deep, interwoven connection with the
        pre- and post- artifact systems they exist in the classical 'complete'
        form for only the briefest of instances The connection with the
        pre-artifact system is obvious. For example, the 'artifact' output of a
        Wikipedia entry is a continued iteration — the product of a highly
        specialized pre-artifact system. The artifacts emerging from Domino owe
        nearly everything to the existence of a pre-artifact system — the
        vetting of ideas on a blog, the conversation with readers. Once a
        physical artifact is 'completed,' printed, boxed and shipped, it's done.
        It can't change. We may scribble notes in the margins of our copy, but
        the next person to pick up a different copy won't see those notes. They
        get the same blank 'complete' edition we got. For only the briefest of
        instances — seconds, perhaps, for popular authors — does the digital
        edition of a book exist in this static, classic, 'complete' form. The
        moment a Kindle edition of a book is downloaded and highlighted it has
        been altered. The next person to download a copy of that book will be
        downloading the 'complete' form plus all associated marginalia. And the
        greater the integration of systems of marginalia, the greater the impact
        that subsequent conversations around the book will have on future
        readers. The digital artifact, therefore, is a scaffolding between the
        pre- and post- artifact systems. Formats This scaffolding between
        systems is defined in formats. EPUB, HTML, Mobi and iOS applications are
        the most popular. The most pervasive digital book format is undeniably
        HTML. EPUB and Mobi are effectively subsets of HTML. And woven into
        EPUB3 is the promise of robust HTML5, CSS3 and enhanced Javascript
        capabilities. The most popular digital formats file into three neat
        categories. They are: Formless: ePub, Mobi, HTML Definite: PDF, EPUB3
        (HTML5/CSS3) Interactive: iOS / Android, EPUB3 (HTML5/CSS3) Formless and
        definite are concepts I outlined at length in Books in the Age of the
        iPad. Formless refers to content that has no inherent visual structure,
        and for which the meaning doesn't change as the words reflow. Think:
        paperback novels. Definite refers to content for which the structure of
        the page — the juxtapositionment of elements — is intertwined with the
        meaning of the text. Think: textbooks. Interactive is, of course, for
        works that necessitate some interactive component: video, non-linear
        storytelling, etc. There is overlap between these categories. Which is
        why we see some formats appearing more than once — EPUB3, for instance.
        You may need to have control over both the visual structure of a page as
        well as the interactivity it suggests. iOS applications could fill all
        three categories, but it's a tool not best suited for the job. We've
        seen this in iPad magazine design and distribution during 2010. Most of
        those magazines could have been PDFs or HTML5 documents. And readers
        would have been better for it (smaller downloads; selectable,
        searchable, resizable 'real' text, etc). EPUB3 seems poised to be the
        one format to rule them all. Why? Already, EPUB is light and well
        defined. Documents produced with it are inherently composed of real text
        and naturally integrate with everyman accessible distribution systems
        like iBooks, Kindle or as direct downloads from publishers. Moving
        forward, it will align with the latest HTML5 layout capabilities and
        allow embedding of robust javascript functionality for interactivity. If
        the pre-artifact system incubates the artifact. And the digital artifact
        glues the pre- and post- artifact systems together. Then of just what,
        precisely, is the post-artifact system composed? 4. The post-artifact
        system Reading is, if nothing else, telepathy. Stephen King, in On
        Writing, after describing a table with a red cloth, cage, rabbit and
        blue number eight: I sent you a table with a red cloth on it, a cage, a
        rabbit, and the number eight in blue ink. You saw them all, especially
        that blue eight. We've engaged in an act of telepathy. No mythy-mountain
        shit; real telepathy. But — and here's the real magic — it's a shared
        telepathy. A telepathy from one to many, and in that, the many have
        experiential overlap. Printed matter binds this experience to pulp. With
        digital, there is the promise of networking that shared experience. We
        give form to our private telepathy through marginalia — marks,
        highlights, notes in the margins. Years ago, I remember — before Kindles
        and iPads and before anyone knew of EPUB — hearing about the marginalia
        found in the books of Paul Rand's library. I remember thinking how
        exciting it would be to browse his thoughts. To sort by them. To order
        them and share them. Use them as pivots for discussions. Comment around
        them. Draw lines from them and the books to which they were connected,
        to other books and the thoughts of other designers. To unlock, as it
        were, the marks of his telepathic experiences. This is the post-artifact
        system. A system of unlocking. A system concerned with engagement.
        Sharing. Marginalia. Ownership. Community. And, of course, reading. It's
        the system that transforms the book from isolated vessel for text into a
        shared interface. It's a system that's beginning to appear in fits and
        starts in reading applications we use today. It's the system most
        directly connected with readers. And it's a system that, when executed
        well, makes going back to printed books feel positively neutered.
        Structurally, marginalia represents a potentially infinite layering atop
        the content. Manifested properly, each new person who participates in
        the production of digital marginalia changes the reading experience of
        that book for the next person. Analog marginalia doesn't know other
        analog marginalia. Digital marginalia is a collective conversation,
        cumulative stratum. Marginalia is, of course, nothing new. Like old Paul
        Rand, as long as we've had books we've been scribbling in them. Spilling
        coffee on them. Covering them in the dirt and dust of travel. Sometimes
        deliberately, sometimes unknowingly marking them with memories. One
        classic manifestation of this mental detritus is the commonplace book.
        Liz Danzico expounds: When John Locke began taking notes in 1652, he did
        so in such an elaborate way that a publisher named John Bell published a
        notebook called Bell's Common-Place Book, Formed generally upon the
        Principles Recommended and Practised by Mr Locke. This notebook, eight
        pages of instructions on an indexing method, was for the first time a
        way of making it easier to navigate an otherwise messy semblance of
        notes and thoughts. I outlined several requests for the networked book
        around notes and marginalia in my April 2010 essay Embracing the Digital
        Book. "Show me the overlap of 10,000 readers' highlighted passages in a
        digital book," I demanded. "Let Stefan Sagmeister publicly share the
        passages he's highlighted in the new Murakami Haruki novel." I then went
        on: "When I'm done reading and marking a book, I should be able to
        create my own abridged copy. Show me just my highlights with notes. Let
        me export this edition. Let me email it to myself. Or, if you dare,
        automatically typeset it and let me order a POD copy for my personal
        library." Soon after I completed that article Amazon released their
        Popular Highlights functionality. Of all the large forces in the world
        of digital books, few are pushing forward as hard and fast as Amazon.
        They have already constructed the infrastructure for our networked
        commonplace books. Mine lives here. Seth Godin's lives here. It needs
        work, of course, but it's a start. Beyond Books This post-artifact space
        need not be saddled only atop books. The notions of community and
        engagement pivoting atop content can be applied to anything — magazines,
        blog posts, longform journalism. Two things are necessary for true
        innovation and engagement to happen in this space: A well defined and
        open protocol. It is to this which all software and tools built to
        engage the post-artifact space can connect. The ability to construct
        canvas independent hooks beyond the reading space. Regarding the
        protocol, James Bridle with his Open Bookmarks initiative is pushing the
        conversation forward as to what the shape of this protocol might be.
        Imagine a future where instead of lending someone a book, you lend them
        your bookmarks. Where your notes, annotations and references are
        synchronized across platforms and applications. Where your bookmarks
        belong to you, and a record of every book you read is saved and stored
        securely, no matter how or where you read it. And then: Open Bookmarks
        is a project to discuss and develop standards for saving, storing and
        sharing bookmarks, annotations and reading data in ebooks. Open
        Bookmarks will champion these principles and support widespread
        adoption. EPUB3 seems to hold the most promise for constructing hooks
        beyond the reading space (outside of the Kindle or iBooks or Nook).
        Particularly so in the book space. It's fair to say building one-off,
        platform-dependent applications on a book-by-book (or issue-by-issue
        basis) doesn't work very well. It's a stop-gap solution as distribution
        and rendering platforms settle and mature. EPUB3 brings with it the
        promise of standardization in allowing authors and publishers
        cross-platform post-artifact solutions. In other words: allowing readers
        to share conversations about their book, within their books, but
        independent of the service. I asked Keith Fahlgren, of Threepress and
        co-creator of Ibis Reader — just where EPUB is heading regarding the
        networked book. And specifically about those external javascript hooks.
        Regarding its current state in 2011 he said: Apple already supports
        JavaScript in iBooks today (for EPUB pre-3), but they deliberately
        prevent network access for security reasons. I doubt they'll change
        their position very quickly. But: We expect some EPUB3 Reading Systems
        to allow JS network access for EPUB3 documents from "trusted parters"
        (this is probably what licensed versions of Ibis Reader will do). I have
        no idea if this will take off beyond a small subset of publishers in the
        medium term. Still, the opportunity! We can define just how EPUB3 and
        the post-artifact space will align: ... EPUB3 is, at least for the next
        week or so, a blessedly empty canvas. If some cool publisher and Reading
        System felt there was a market opportunity for non-toy JavaScript and
        worked together on something that they promoted widely, I think it'd be
        quite possible that they could steer most EPUB3 Reading Systems (which
        are being built or to be built) in some direction or another. While
        JavaScript security issues for ebooks are quite real, there's also
        serious innovation in JavaScript land these days, as you know, so
        someone (probably well outside the ebook space) may come up with a
        compelling restricted subset of JavaScript (or something) that can have
        some network access but won't ruin everything. Robin Sloan in his blog
        post, Inventing Books, reminds us of publishing innovation in the 15th
        and 16th century and concludes with: This is all hap­pen­ing again,
        right now. Now sure: history's not a spiral, and our case is new—the
        inter­net is not the print­ing press and the Kindle Store is not the
        Frankfurt fair. But there's some­thing in the feel­ing, if not the
        details, that's the same. The great opportunity, the greater
        confusion—and great­est of all, the lure of invention. So many
        questions: How often will tech geeks and lovers of literature have a
        chance to (re)invent our evolving relationship with books? While EPUB3
        may hold promise for books, what about the rest of content? Who will
        provide the platform for the conversations around magazine articles?
        Longform journalism? Blogs? How will these spaces connect? Are there
        more interesting solutions than the currently deployed blog commenting
        tools? There is a gaping opportunity to consolidate our myriad
        marginalia into an even more robust commonplace book. One searchable,
        always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the digital text
        we consume. An evocation — the application of heat to the secret lemon
        juice letter — of our shared telepathy. 5. The future books we make So —
        just what is a book, anymore, anyway? To answer that is to look at the
        changes in our publishing systems. Engagement with readers (the building
        of community and conversation) begins immediately in the pre-artifact
        system. The two year disconnect between Idea and Readers is minimized to
        hours, days or weeks. The line between Publisher and Author is blurred.
        If you choose to print, The Great Immutable Artifact is now only The
        Immutable Artifact. The production time (from finished manuscript to
        readers' hands) of a digital artifact is significantly less than that of
        a physical book. The classic authority of access to distribution is
        heavily deemphasized in digital. Digital distribution channels such as
        Amazon's Kindle store and Apple's iBooks store are universally
        accessible. Anyone with an ePub file can reach critical, global points
        of sale. A true networked post-artifact system of additive conversation
        and marginalia exists only digitally. This, now As I stated before, we
        will always debate: the quality of the paper, the pixel density of the
        display; the cloth used on covers, the interface for highlighting;
        location by page, location by paragraph. This is not what matters.
        Surface is secondary. The ditch digging, the setting of steel, the
        pouring of concrete for the foundation of the future book. This is what
        requires our efforts. Clearly defined scope of these systems, clearly
        defined open protocols. These are what require our discussion. Tools
        with simple, quiet, clean interfaces organically surfacing our changing
        relationship with text. These are what we need to build. All of these
        efforts combined, these systems integrated, these tools made well and
        deliberately. This is the future book. Our platform for post-artifact
        books and publishing.
